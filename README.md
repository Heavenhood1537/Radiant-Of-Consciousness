# Radiant of Human Consciousness

A 3D web app inspired by Isaac Asimov's Foundation, mapping the evolution of human consciousness. Milestones of thought are plotted in a sphere (1 cm = 1000 years), with positions tied to their geographical origins on Earth.

## Live Demo
- Netlify: https://radiantofconsciousness.netlify.app
- GitHub Pages: (to be added after enabling GitHub Pages)

## How to Contribute
I’m looking for help with coding (Three.js) and data collection to expand the milestone dataset to 300–500 entries. This is a GPL-licensed project—join me to visualize humanity’s intellectual journey!
